# EDA-of-Data-Science-Jobs-on-Glassdoor

##Introduction  

Today, we find ourselves at a critical juncture where data has assumed paramount importance and relevance. Consequently, a growing number of individuals are making the transition into the field of data science, recognizing the substantial demand for data experts across various industries. However, despite the clear need for more data professionals, the competition remains fierce, and many individuals are encountering difficulties in securing employment.

##Project Aim  

The aim of this project is to perform an in-depth exploratory data analysis on data science job postings found on Glassdoor in the United States of America. The primary goal is to offer valuable insights that can prove beneficial to job seekers. By delving into the specific skill sets and qualifications necessary to secure a role as a data expert, identifying sectors that have a higher demand for data experts, pinpointing cities with high hiring rates, and understanding the salary ranges within different sectors and ownership types, this project strives to assist job seekers in their pursuit of employment.

##Data Source and Description
The data used for the project was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/data-science-job-posting-on-glassdoor?select=Uncleaned_DS_jobs.csv). The data had been scrapped from Glassdoorâ€™s website and was subsequently made available on Kaggle. The data set used was uncleaned and contained about 14 columns and 672 rows.

##Data preparation and processing.
The data was analyzed using Python. All necessary Python libraries were imported, and the dataset was also imported. All unnecessary columns and strings were removed from the dataset. The Jupyter notebook in the repository shows the steps taken to clean and analyze the data. Power BI was also used to visualize the data. 

##Insights and Recommendations
  1.	San Francisco, California, emerged as the location with the highest number of job openings for data science roles. Therefore, I recommend that job seekers consider exploring opportunities in the city to increase their chances of securing employment. 
  2.	The information Technology sector exhibited the highest volume of open positions for data experts. Despite the Information Technology sector having the most job openings, the average salary offered in this sector is not as high when compared to sectors such as Consumer Services and Media. However, it's worth noting that job availability in these higher-paying sectors is relatively low. For newcomers to the data field, I recommend considering opportunities in the Information Technology sector initially and gradually exploring higher-paying sectors as they progress in their careers.
  3.	The analysis highlighted that proficiency in R and Python are the most sought-after skills for data science jobs. Moreover, most job listings require only a bachelor's degree. Consequently, job seekers may benefit more from investing their time in mastering these required skills rather than solely focusing on acquiring additional degrees.
  4.	Private companies were observed to hire more data experts compared to other ownership types. 
  5.	Although various job titles exist for data experts, "Data Scientist" emerged as the most common job title. This suggests that companies tend to hire more data scientists compared to other specialized data roles such as data engineers. 

In conclusion, this project has provided valuable insights that can assist job seekers, aspiring data scientists and employers in making informed decisions within the dynamic field of data science.
